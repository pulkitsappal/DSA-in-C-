Question:-You are developing a smartphone app. You have a list of potential customers for your app. Each customer has a budget and will buy the app at your declared price if and only if the price is less than or equal to the customer's budget.
You want to fix a price so that the revenue you earn from the app is maximized. Find this maximum possible revenue.
For instance, suppose you have 4 potential customers and their budgets are 30, 20, 53 and 14. In this case, the maximum revenue you can get is 60 .


Solution:-
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int main() {
    
    int t, n, i;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    
    while(t--){
        scanf("%d", &n);
        int a[n];
        for(i=0; i<n; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        
        std::sort(a, a+n);
        
        int maxp = 0;
        int p;
        
        for(i=0; i<n; i++){
            p = a[i] * (n - i);
            if(p>maxp) maxp = p;
        }
        
        printf("%d\n", maxp);
    }
	return 0;
}
